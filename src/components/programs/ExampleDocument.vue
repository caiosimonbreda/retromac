      The 1990s was the decade when Apple gained a comparative advantage in the
      personal computers field by portraying their products as cool, innovative,
      fun and well designed (1998 – Chic. Not Geek campaign, 1999 – the Thrill
      of Surfing campaign and so forth). Furthermore, it was the 1990s who
      triggered the famous Think different slogan. From this point one, the road
      they've taken seems irreversible and will steadily transform Apple into
      the huge company that it is today.
